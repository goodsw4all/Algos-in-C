# Algorithms in C
Implementation of algorithms & data structures.<br>
You may use this code snippets for practice algorithms and data structures in C.<br> 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- gcc toolchains, make (of course, you got it if you use mac or linux)
- Unit Test Framework 
https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion.git

$ sudo apt-get install criterion-dev
```

### Build
Each folder has *Makefile*
